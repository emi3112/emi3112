- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @emi3112
  
After exploring various small jobs,
I discovered my true passion for programming.
Drawn to the logic and endless possibilities offered by coding,
I pursued an in-depth training that led to my certification in computer development.

Coding has become much more than just a skill for me. 
It has become a true passion and a constant source of learning. 
Every day, I explore new technologies and take on new challenges to deepen my knowledge and improve my skills.

Thanks to my determination and efforts, 
I have been accepted to Epitech in Lyon, a renowned institution in the field of technology. 
My goal is to further develop my knowledge and skills in artificial intelligence, web development, and mobile development.

I am driven by a thirst for learning and self-improvement in these exciting fields. 
I am ready to tackle any challenges that come my way in order to become a accomplished professional in the field of computer development.
